Bank Management System
A Python-based Bank Management System that connects to a MySQL database to handle user accounts, transactions, and feedback. This project is a testament to how we try to impose order on chaos, even if it’s just updating a database.

Features
User Management: Add, update, and delete user accounts with minimal human error (or as close as we can get).
Feedback Handling: Because even databases deserve to know what they’re doing wrong.
Dynamic Updates: Only change what you want; the rest remains in its default, untouched state—like your inner peace.
Error Handling: Prevents crashes when faced with the void (empty inputs).
